This is a complex PDF document.
It contains multiple pages with more structured and detailed text.
The purpose is to test the extraction of text from a more complex document.
The second page of the complex PDF document contains additional information.
We include more text here to simulate a more detailed and lengthy document.
Continuing on the third page, we see more detailed descriptions and structured text.
This helps us test the robustness of our PDF text extraction process.
Finally, this is the fourth page of the complex PDF document.
The test should handle all pages and extract text correctly.
Thank you for reading through this complex PDF.
